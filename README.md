## Description
I wanted to be able to generate an html page for team projects. Having a page to keep track of my group helps keep things organized and makes it easy to find contact info for my team and important links, like their github accounts or school info. 
    
## Installation
to install this program, you will need a package.json installled with dependenecies: inquirer ver. 6.3.1 and jest 26.5.2 installed. you will also need Node.js (version 18) installed and ready to go in your  VS Code terminal. 

## Usage Info
to run the program once you have the software and dependencies installed, simply run `node index.js` in your VS code terminal.  You will then be prompted to answer questions about your team, and when you have selected that your team is complete,  an html page will be generated in the `dist` folder.
